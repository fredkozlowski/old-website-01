	<h1>Web Dev Dictionary</h1>

	<p>I had an urge to learn web development, except the sheer amount of stuff out there available to build a website with was incredibly disorientating. As I went around researching each technology/language/framework, I wrote one sentence definitions of them for myself. I’m putting it here and I will update it as I keep learning.</p>

	<p>Frontend - Part of the website the user interacts with</p>

	<p>Backend - Stuff on the server</p>

	<p>HTML - Holds the content of the webpage</p>

	<p>CSS - Makes the webpage have formatting and cool colors</p>

	<p>Sass - Makes CSS better and allows you to have variables and logic</p>

	<p>JavaScript - Allows your website to have dynamic stuff like animations or interactivity</p>

	<p>EJS - Generates HTML from Javascript code, not to be confused with Express, Ext JS, ES6</p>

	<p>JQuery - A library that allows you to do things that’d take a couple of lines of code in JS in a single line</p>

	<p>Ajax - Not a technology but a technique that allows you to update part of a webpage without reloading the whole thing</p>

	<p>Bootstrap - A library that allows you to make nice looking websites really fast by including HTML, CSS, and JS templates for things</p>

	<p>Node JS - Allows you to have your server run JavaScript. Useful because now you only need to learn JS to do frontend and backend development</p>

	<p>Express - Simplifies some tasks in Node JS</p>

	<p>PHP - JavaScript but old and different. Used for backend</p>

	<p>JSON - Data storage format</p>

	<p>XML - JSON but worse</p>

	<p>MongoDB - Fancy JSON database</p>

	<p>TypeScript - A superset of Javascript which adds static typing</p>
