	<h1>Reading List </h1>

	<h4 id="what-i-want-to-read">What I want to read</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Dune and Dune Messiah - I read Dune a few years ago and I absolutely loved it, but I never got around to reading the sequel. With the movie coming out this seems like the right time.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Stuff by Nassim Nicholas Taleb - I read Black Swan recently. It was entertaining and had some good tidbits so I’m interested in what else he has to say.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Inner Game of Work - Inspired by Michael Ashcroft on Twitter. I’m also interested in how this intersects with The Art of Learning.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Chaos by Gleick - Want to read purely on the recommendation of Sapolsky.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Contemporary Political Philosophy by Kymlicka- Friend recommended.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Seeing like a State by Scott - Scott Alexander’s review was insanely compelling. I think the book merits a full read.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World by Girard - Rene Girard is obviously pushed hard by Peter Thiel, but aside from that Alex Danco’s review of Girard’s philosophy was interesting. I’ve been interpreting the world through that perspective somewhat often now, so I’d like to read the full book.</p>
		</li>
