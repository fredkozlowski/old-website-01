	<h1>Media That Has Made Me Who I Am</h1>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Arthur Clarke’s short stories - Scifi in it’s purest form - Blew my mind as a kid. Singlehandedly inspired me to learn how technology works and got me excited for the future.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Matterhorn - Vietnam war novel - There but for the grace of God go I. It was an experience reading this.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>How To Be A Victorian - A historical book detailing how Victorians actually lived - Opened my eyes to how people in the past weren’t any different from us today, they just operated under different incentives and constraints.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber - Short story by Hemingway about courage - I read this at a pivotal time in my teenage years when I was taking on a more risk-taking attitude.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h4 id="movies">Movies</h4>

	<ul>

			<p>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty - Man goes from daydreamer to global adventurer - Seriously influenced me to become more adventurous as a person.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Tampopo - A Japanese ramen western - It inspired me to take food more seriously. It has an outsized effect on me anyways, I might as well give it the respect it calls for.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h4 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Mad Men - A show about an ad agency in the 60’s - The only show where I felt like I KNEW the characters. I haven’t ever rewatched it because my memory of watching it the first time is so mindblowing.</li>
